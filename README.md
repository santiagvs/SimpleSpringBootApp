# Simple Spring API

This project is a simple API created with Java and Spring to learn more about the language and the framework, as well some design patterns to be used on real Spring projects.

To run this project via command line, clone it with `git clone **this-repo-url**` and be sure to have __Maven__ installed on your machine. If you use some kind of IDE to run the project like IntelliJ, Eclipse or Visual Studio Code, there are many guides on the internet and even Spring documentation provides it, like this [VSCode guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/guides-with-vscode/) or [IntelliJ IDEA guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/intellij-idea/).

To run with Maven (quick documentation [here](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html)), simply get into the root folder of this project (that is, where the `pom.xml` file is located) and run:

```linux
mvn spring-boot:run
```
